# Hospital Quality of Care Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital quality of care using Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) data. The goal is to understand patterns in excess readmission ratios and explore how hospital volume and geography relate to hospital performance.

## Datasets Used
- FY 2025 Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (CMS)
- Hospital General Information dataset (CMS)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SciPy (for hypothesis testing)

## Project Components
1. Theory / Research Report (PDF)
2. Action Plan (PDF)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing (Jupyter Notebook)

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and aggregation to hospital level
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Comparison of readmission performance by hospital volume
- Statistical hypothesis testing (t-test, ANOVA)
- Visualizations to communicate insights
